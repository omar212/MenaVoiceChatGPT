## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the dependencies using `npm install`.

3. Get your OpenAI API key and OpenAI org key:
   - Go to the [OpenAI website](https://openai.com/) and create an account if you haven't already.
   - After logging in, navigate to the [API page](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api/overview) and click on the "Create new API key" button.
   - Follow the prompts to create a new API key.
   - Make sure to copy the API key and org key and keep them in a safe place.

4. Get your Eleven Labs API key:
   - Go to the [Eleven Labs website](https://eleven-labs.com/en/) and create an account if you haven't already.
   - After logging in, navigate to the [API page](https://docs.elevensights.com/reference/welcome-to-elevensights-api) and follow the instructions to get your API key.
